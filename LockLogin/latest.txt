3.4.9
- Fixed a bug with MySQL
- Fixed players were able to open and interact 
  with custom inventories (player inventory "e" 
  keeps being accessible, but any interaction will 
  close the inventory)
- Fixed a potential problem with max accounts system,
  I recommend you to completly remove LockLogin/data
